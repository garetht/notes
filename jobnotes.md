Dos and Don'ts
===

* Treat every interview as your **dream job**
* Courtesy emails after meetings/phone calls
* Before a phone screening, look at
  * 'about' page on website, last two blog posts
  * Crunchbase profile - background profile of company and its trajectory - + Techcrunch history
  * LinkedIn profile of interviewer
* Go to every interview with insightful questions


* Don't count on your first five interviews
* Don't stop improving your whiteboard code before you're asked to - don't want someone who solves the problem, meeting the minimum requirements - want someone who keeps working at it - naive solution, step back, and improve 
* Don't ask about compensation before getting an offer
